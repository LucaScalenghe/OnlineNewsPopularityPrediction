# OnlineNewsPopularityPrediction
Abstract â€” This report proposes an approach to building a
predictive system for the popularity of online news. The proposed
solution to the problem contains an analysis of the given dataset
and provides insights on the dynamics that drive diffusion of
information having a big impact in the media industry. The
explanation of the regression pipeline is then presented and a
comparison between several known models that led to achieve
good performances following the RMSE metric.

I. PROBLEM OVERVIEW
We are currently living in the Digital Age where increasingly more time is spent online and the consumption
of information has shifted from paper-based to the use of
electronic devices. In the digital world there is currently a
paradigm shift were news are consumed through social media
and therefore their visibility is not uniform but based on their
public appealingness. This mechanism shifts the production of
the content. The understanding of the factors that contribute
to the sharing of news and articles is critical for the players
in the media space. The prediction of sharing by analysing
the components and metadata relative to an article can be of
extreme benefit for industry insiders
